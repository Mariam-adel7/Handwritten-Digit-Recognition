# Handwritten Digit Recognition

## 🧠 Project Overview  
This project implements a handwritten-digit recognition system (digits 0–9) using deep learning. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset — a widely used benchmark dataset for handwritten digit classification.  

The project includes:  
- Data loading and preprocessing  
- Model architecture and training using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)  
- Evaluation on a test set  
- Optionally — inference for new handwritten images
